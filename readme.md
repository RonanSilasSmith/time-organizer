As of writing this readme I have not finished yet, I am in the process of making the script load saved arrays into HTML

I don't exactly know what a readme is supposed to entail yet, so I'm just going to give a brief description of the project, and then a slightly humorous rant on the primary issues I encountered in the process of creation;

I'm trying to respond to the feedback given with my last assignment and incorperating a readme, but I am not 100% sure I'm doing it right, either way i will seek to improve this in the future;

The idea of this project is there's a 9-5 schedule, this gives you a timetable to work on; This project is basically an hour calendar so you could track progress in a 9-5 schedule; It should have been very simple;

despite not being finished I can say that the solutions I manage from this point forward will be just awful; The worst part is after coming this far, the only way I can make it work is to butcher the idea of ellegant code;

The idea of resetting the page after every save sounds awful, but at this point in the code I have written myself into a corner with hours of work catching up with me;

either way, I'm confident that the end product will function perfectly; I have the infrastructure to do what was asked of me; I just hate everything about the direction I took it;


Ok, about 15 minutes passed after I wrote this readme, things were looking up for the project actually. Then everything broke. Like badly. especially localStorage.
